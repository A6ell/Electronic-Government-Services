EGOV - Government Services Web Application EGOV is a web application built using the Flask framework to streamline and digitize government services. The project aims to transition traditionally in-person services, such as applying for a driver's license, birth certificate, and national ID, to an online platform. With WebSAT, users can sign up, log in, and conveniently apply for these essential services from the comfort of their homes.
